# Feature Flag
Simple feature flag library for node js.

## TODO:
1. Add a way to group flags by some value. For example, a group of users could have a value set for that group id.
1. Errors looking up a value are ignored. Should they be surfaced to the caller via a callback?
1. Unit test.
1. Add a timeout to the amount of time to spend looking up flags.
1. Make sure everything works in the browser.
1. Write tests for once lock.
1. Determine name of synchronization pattern OnceLock is using.
